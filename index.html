<h1>Cody Steckler</h1> <!-- Headed the page with my dog's name -->
<p>Welcome to my site. It's dedicated to my dog, named <em>Cody</em>. He's a Shih Tzu and he's 10 years old. He has such a personality and brings nothing but love to my family.</p> <!-- Added a description of my site with the paragraph tag. Italicized 'Cody' with the em tag -->

<img src="Cody1.png" alt="Cody"> <!-- Added an image of Cody by connecting a local image of him -->

<br>

<p>Here is a webpage from a website that is similar to mine.</p>

<br>

<p><strong>Some HTML elements I recognize:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Strong - makes text bold</li>
  <li>div - separates like sections</li>
  <li>img src - inserts an image</li>
  <li>& + nbsp - creates empty space</li>
  <li>p - creates paragraph text</li>
  <li>ul - creates unordered list</li>
  <li>li - creates item in list</li>
  <li>a href + /filename - links you to other part of site</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some HTML elements I don't recognize:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>iframe - creates a frame within a frame?</li>
  <li>text-indent - indents text?</li>
  <li>font-family - font, with two other backup fonts?</li>
  <li>span - separates HTML section?</li>
  <li>id - is this a CSS element?</li>
  <li>script - brings in code from a different source ie. Javascript?</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>I think this website is good because it's straight-forward and user-friendly. The title at the top lets you know exactly what the website is about, and the webpage is very clearly dedicated to showing photos of labradors. The nav bar is on the side and easy to use. The colors of the website coordinate with each other. It's great.</p>
