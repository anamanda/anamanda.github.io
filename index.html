<p class="center-align">Welcome to my site. It's dedicated to my dog, named <em>Cody</em>. He's a Shih Tzu and he's 10 years old. He has such a personality and brings nothing but love to my family.</p> <!-- Added a description of my site with the paragraph tag. Italicized 'Cody' with the em tag. Used class to align center -->

<!-- Inserted links and used class to align center -->

<p class="center-align">I think this website is good because it's straight-forward and user-friendly. The title at the top lets you know exactly what the website is about, and the webpage is very clearly dedicated to showing photos of labradors. The nav bar is on the side and easy to use. The colors of the website coordinate with each other. It's great.</p>
